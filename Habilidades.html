									Gaara has large reserves of strong chakra, a fact Akamaru recognises even before Gaara has performed any technique. His chakra levels are partly because he is the jinchūriki of Shukaku, but even after Shukaku is removed from his body in Part II, there is no noticeable difference in his performance. In battle, Gaara tends to stay away from his opponents and rarely uses taijutsu. In the anime, he acknowledges this as a shortcoming and therefore trains with Shira to improve his abilities. In the novelisation of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki regards Gaara's taijutsu as being on par with Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Darui, stating that their skill in this particular style of combat is "first-class".

							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">gesture</i>Sand manipulation</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body"><span>
								As Shukaku's jinchūriki, Gaara is able to manipulate sand. He carries a supply of sand wherever he goes in a gourd, which itself is made from sand. This personal sand is infused with his own chakra, allowing him to deploy it faster and manipulate it more precisely. If he needs more sand, he can either use sand from the surroundings or, if there isn't any, use his personal sand to break down minerals in the ground to create some; these secondary sand supplies require more chakra to control. Gaara's ability to manipulate sand remains even after Shukaku is removed from his body. Indeed, upon seeing how much sand Gaara can control at once, the Fourth Kazekage wrongly assumes it is Shukaku itself doing so.</span></div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i>Strategy</div>
								<div class="collapsible-body"><span>In battle, Gaara's usual tactic is to remain stationary, using his sand to attack opponents from afar. The attacks typically follow the same formula: capture and immobilise the target, such as with the Sand Binding Coffin, and then crush all parts of their body, such as with the Sand Waterfall Funeral. If opponents are able to get close enough to attack him, Gaara's Shield of Sand automatically protects him from all threats, even those he is not aware of; the Shield of Sand is commonly thought to be Shukaku's doing, an act of self-preservation, but it is actually Gaara's mother, Karura, whose love protects Gaara even after her death. If the Shield of Sand is penetrated, either through speed or brute-force, Gaara also has access to a secondary Armour of Sand covering his body; however, it requires an impractical amount of chakra to maintain for long periods of time and weighs him down.[26] Nevertheless, Gaara's sand is extremely effective at keeping him safe, earning fame as an "absolute defence" and allowing him to go years without experiencing a single injury. By adulthood, Gaara's Shield of Sand's defence increased tremendously, able to shrug off attacks that Sasuke Uchiha's Majestic Attire: Susanoo could not.</span></div>

						<span class="card-title">Sand Waterfall Imperial Funeral</span>
						<p>This technique is a specialty of Gaara's, where he makes the land a stage for his representation. This technique is identical to Sand Waterfall Funeral in that the stream of sand crushes the enemy. But as far as scale goes, this is in a totally different league. One may be able to hold their own against a single attack, but multiple obliterations are where this technique shines. Gaara slams both hands down onto the sand, creating powerful shock waves that compress the sand. Anything buried in the sand is subsequently crushed. </p>

						<span class="card-title">Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal</span>
						<p>Using a large quantity of sand, the user covers the enemy with several successive layers of the material, before compressing it into the form of a huge pyramid which serves to imprison the target upon its completion. Sealing tags can be placed onto the pyramid to increase its sealing power, or Shukaku can strengthen the seal with the juinjutsu that cover its body. </p>

						<span class="card-title">Sand Binding Coffin</span>
						<p>With his ability to control sand, Gaara encases his opponents in a large amount of the special chakra-infused sand kept inside his gourd, immobilising them. It can be used to suffocate an opponent or in preparation for a deadlier technique, the Sand Waterfall Funeral. </p>

						<span class="card-title">Armour of Sand</span>
						<p>Using this technique, Gaara can cover himself in a compacted layer of sand, providing an additional defence should his Shield of Sand fail; combined, these two are known as Gaara's "Absolute Defence" (絶対防御, Zettai Bōgyo). Though quite effective, maintaining the armour requires a large amount of chakra and stamina. Furthermore, it is nowhere as resilient as the Shield of Sand, since it easily breaks away upon impact, indicating that the sole purpose of the armour is to absorb impact channelled unto Gaara's body during battle. Another weakness is the additional weight of the sand which leads to decreased levels of speed and mobility. This weakness is easily bypassed by the fact Gaara is not a taijutsu specialist and uses long-ranged sand attacks and he uses sand as a form of transportation.  </p>
